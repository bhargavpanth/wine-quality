### Data pre-processing

* Check the data distribution - In this stage, we understand if the dataset(s) are scaled roughly by the same factor
* Check for redundant entries - Redundant entries make a model biased
* Check for empty value (null,0,N/A) in any of the rows - Data cleaning

#### Observations from data (feature engineering)
* Explanatory variables pair - white wine (alchol vs quality)
* 


## IMPORTANT
* Add confidence interval graphs to substantiate the claim that we make at the end
* Calculate the true mean i.e : calculate the mean by taking the reading multiple times
